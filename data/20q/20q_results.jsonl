In that book, a supercomputer named Deep Thought is built to find the ultimate answer to life, the universe, and everything. After a lot of computation, it comes up with the answer 42.

Since the user has given up, they're asking for confirmation of the answer. The answer is indeed 42, as per the reference. I need to make sure there's no other possible interpretation, but given the context, it's safe to say the answer is 42.
