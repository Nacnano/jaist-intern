Please write a Python code for running in a Google Colab using an A100 GPU. 
I want to test whether Language models are truly random for 2 tasks, randomizing numbers and words.

Requirement :  

- Models
    - Download models from Hugging Face (use Qwen around 8B-14B with good reasoning ability)
    - Use model from Gemini api (Gemini2.5flash) 

- Prompt 2 cases : 1. Normal Query and 2. Use CoT reasoning  

- Ask it to randomize 2 tasks, a single number, and a word multiple times (more than 100)  

- For each task, please make it configurable to generate multiple numbers or words in a single query (ex: [1, 3, 5] mean generate 1, 3, and 5 numbers per each query)

- Please make the output be in formats that is easy to further use

- During the loop, please print out the progress

- Summarize the results distribution as JSONL files 

- Store their reasoning in JSONL files

- Save the file in "MyDrive/nac/"

- Make it easy to config

- Use print instead of logging
